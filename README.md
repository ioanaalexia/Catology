# Catology 
Catology is an AI-powered system designed to identify a cat's breed based on its attributes. The project leverages machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis to process descriptions of cats, extract relevant features, and determine the most likely breed.
## Features
### Dataset Augmentation:
- Translates and expands the existing dataset with new instances.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Extracts relevant attributes from natural language descriptions.
- Generates human-readable breed summaries.
- Enables breed comparison in natural language.
### Data Preprocessing & Validation:
- Detects and handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Displays instance counts per breed and extracts unique attribute values.

### Statistical Analysis & Visualization:
- Generates histograms, box plots, and distribution graphs.
- Identifies correlations between attributes and breeds.

### Machine Learning Models:
- Converts categorical data into numerical format.
- Trains classifiers to predict a cat's breed based on extracted features.
- Evaluates performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies & Tools
### Programming language:
- Python

### Libraries used:
- Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`;
- NLP: `NLTK`, `spaCy`;
- Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`;
